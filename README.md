# Papaya
Context This is an image dataset (JPEG)of papaya fruit. The objective is to predict the ripening of the papaya fruit using digital imaging.  Content A total of 131 samples from 57 fruits are used for the experiments. These fruits are classified into three stages of maturity (EM1, EM2 and EM3). Some images present more than one acquisition, having more than one image.
